<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b><br>

 Hydrogen for current PEM and Alkaline fuel cells must be supplied with no more than a few tens of ppm of CO or CO<font size="1"><sub>2</sub></font>
respectively. If the hydrogen is generated on-site, as it is used, it
must be produced efficiently over a broad fuel cell demand range, and
at this high purity in the face of load changes whose time scale is
typically on the order of seconds. In this paper, we generated hydrogen
for a broad variety of demands from a 1.09/1 molar mix of
methanol/water using commercial water-gas shift catalyst in a membrane
reactor from REB Research. The reactor output hydrogen was fed directly
(dry, unpolished) into a PEM fuel cell from T/J Technologies. Demand
was varied between 0 and .9 A/cm<font size="1"><sup>2</sup></font>,
both in flow through operation (with a bleed) and in dead end operation
(without). We show power densities virtually identical to those with
bottled gas, and better when operated in dead-end mode. We also show
inherent load following where back-pressure in the fuel cell affects
the membrane reactor hydrogen output on a time scale &frac34; 2000&micro;s.<br>
<br>
<b> BACKGROUND:</b><br> Fuel cells in 1 W to 100 kW sizes are being
considered for near term service in several remote and mobile
applications where they provide critical advantages of quiet operation,
reliability and (potentially) high energy density (Whrs/lb): advantages
that justify the current high price of fuel cells. An open question
though, is where the hydrogen is to come from. This is a particularly
pressing question where weight is a premium and the loads must vary, as
in military, boating, camping, automotive and back-up power. Hydrogen
delivery for these applications must be high density (energy/weight &#8222; 1
Watt hr/gm) and must follow a varying load with only a few minutes lag
at most. The hydrogen must be delivered relatively pure, containing a
few tens of ppm CO or CO<font size="1"><sub>2</sub></font> respectively, depending on whether the fuel cell is based on acidic  <u>P</u>olymer <u>E</u>lectrolyte <u>M</u>embranes
(PEM) or on Alkaline solvents. Direct methanol PEM fuel cells are an
attractive, longer range PEM option, but current designs appear to lag
hydrogen fed PEMs in efficiency, cost and delivered power density. <br>
<br> Small scale generation of hydrogen appears to require more than a
scaled down version of large hydrogen plants; miniature petrochemical
designs cost and weigh too much per unit of hydrogen output (1).
Further, load following purity is poor and energy loss due to heat
shedding, and for control and startup / shutdown consumes too large a
fraction of the potential power (2). A recent paper on autothermal
reforming and partial oxidation purification (3) showed that it this
design, too, could not maintain &lt;25 ppm CO concentrations with a
varying load. In this paper we have generated hydrogen using membrane
reactor steam reforming, a technique, developed over the past few years
at REB Research. As a hydrocarbon feed to the reactor, we used a nearly
stoicheometric mixture of methanol and water. We fed the hydrogen
output of the reactor directly into a T/J Technology PEM fuel cell to
test predictions that hydrogen purity and fuel cell electric output are
inherently maintained over a varying load. <br>
<br> The membrane reactor design used in this study is shown in
schematic in Figure 1, and is described previously (4,5). In the
reactor, the methanol water mixture is converted to hydrogen over
conventional water gas shift catalyst (CuZnO from Sudchemie) via the
following reaction:<br>
   CH<font size="1"><sub>3</sub></font>OH + H<font size="1"><sub>2</sub></font>O --&gt; 3H<font size="1"><sub>2</sub></font> + CO<font size="1"><sub>2</sub></font>.<br>
What makes the membrane reactor unique is that, while hydrogen is
formed, it is extracted through metal membranes within the reaction
zone. Hydrogen removal in the reaction zone drives the reaction further
to completion than it would in an ordinary reactor, and increases the
effective catalyst activity by increasing the reactant concentrations
and residence times. <br>
<br> In this reactor we used REB Research&#8217;s palladium-coated metal
sandwich membranes that are effectively 100% selective to hydrogen.
This membrane choice should insure that any hydrogen that passes the
membrane is &gt;99.9999% pure independent of any hydrogen back-pressure
changes caused by varying fuel cell demand. The delivered purity should
be higher than of bottled hydrogen. We wanted to see if this would
result in an exceptional power curve from the fuel cell, that is a
voltage versus current density curve exceeding that for operation with
bottled hydrogen. <br>
<br> We also hoped to be able to run the hydrogen into the fuel cell in
dead-end mode, that is without the typical, periodic bleed of hydrogen
from the fuel cell. Normal reformer hydrogen contains significant
quantities of CO<font size="1"><sub>2</sub></font>,
CO and unreacted fuel which has to be bled from the fuel cell at a rate
that is proportional to the power use, and even bottled hydrogen
generally requires hydrogen is bleeding at regular intervals to prevent
impurities from building up in the fuel cell. In our membrane reactor
the non-hydrogen components are supposed to exit separately from the
hydrogen, via the rafinate stream in Figure 1. Dead end operation
should be more efficient since all the feed hydrogen is used to
generate power. Further, dead end operation should eliminate the need
for proportional bleed control and valving that adds weight and robs
power from the fuel cell. Finally, dead end operation should make
hydration and voltage control easier since there is not a periodic drop
in pressure unrelated to power draw. <br>

<br> Membrane reactor hydrogen, especially in dead end mode, should
result in inherent, instantaneous load following. Because the off-gases
and impurities exit at constant pressure separately from the hydrogen,
a change in hydrogen demand changes only the hydrogen pressure at the
fuel cell. This change feeds back through the membrane to affect
hydrogen partial pressure in the reactor altering the rate of reaction
and the composition of the exhaust gas. The greater the hydrogen
demand, the faster the reaction and the leaner the exhaust gas, with
changes occurring on a time scale that should be determined by the
speed of sound in hydrogen. <br>
<br> One of the authors, REB, has postulated that the preferred heating
mechanism for a membrane reactor is to burn the waste gas (4,5),
supplementing this with combustion of raw feed. The waste gas should be
flammable, containing some 25% of the hydrogen generated. Burning this
waste increases the thermal efficiency; it recycles heat value and can
result in thermal efficiencies in excess of 90%.<br>
<br>
<b>EXPERIMENTAL:<br>
</b><s><br>
 </s> For these experiments, we used a commercial, one
tube membrane reactor from REB Research &amp; Consulting
(www.rebresearch.com). The reactor was 1/2&#8221; in diameter and 8&#8221; tall
containing one membrane tube 6&#8221; tall by 1/8&#8221; diameter plus 17 ccs of
Sudchemie methanol reforming catalyst T-2617. The reactor was wrapped
with 300W heating tape (www.omega.com) and heated to a nominal 260&deg;C
(outside temperature). Temperatures were measured by a K thermocouple
(Watlow inc.) and controlled to &plusmn; 1&deg;C by a thermocouple controller from
Fuji Electric. <br>
<br> The reactor was fed with reagent grade methanol (Aldrich inc.)
mixed with a water purchased at the local supermarket (Absopure&reg; Steam
Distilled Drinking Water) to form a 1:2 by volume water methanol
mixture, equivalent to 1.09 mol H<font size="1"><sub>2</sub></font>O/mol CH<font size="1"><sub>3</sub></font>OH.
The slight excess of water over the 1 :1 molar ratio in Equation 1 is
thought to be beneficial to prevent coking. The methanol-water was
mixed before the beginning of any experiment and held in a polyethylene
holding tank. A medical dosing pump (Pulsatron inc.) took the
methanol-water from the holding tank and fed it to a boiler and then to
the reactor at a constant flow rate 1 cc/min. +/- 5%. Pressure in the
reactor was maintained by a check valve (Swagelok) on the off-gas
stream set to 265 psi, and was measured by a (US Gauge) pressure gauge
&plusmn; 5 psi accuracy. <br>
<br> Before entering the reactor, the methanol water was passed through
a boiler made of 1/8&#8221; diameter coiled copper tube, 5 feet long, wrapped
around the reactor. Wrapping the boiler tube around the reactor this
way was done for convenience; it helps match the boiler temperature to
the reactor temperature, and eliminates the need for a second
controller and heater loop. Both the boiler and reactor were insulated
on the outside with ceramic insulation (Zirtek, inc.) covered with
aluminum foil. <br>
<br>

<br> Hydrogen production upstream of the fuel cell was measured by a
mass flow meter from Aalborg calibrated against a bubble flow meter.
Exiting hydrogen passed a check valve (Swagelok) set to 1 psi to
prevent hydrogen suck-back in the event of an unplanned shut-down.
After passing the reactor check valve, waste gas entered a knockout
drum to collect liquids, water and unreacted methanol. From there,
vapors exited the system through a third check valve set at 1 psi. A
room CO detector (Nightingale, Inc.) was used as a safety measure to
indicate that minimal CO exited with the waste gas. We show the
combination of reactor, boiler, and pump, along with its flows in
Figure 2; for brevity, we refer to it as the Me100 because it combines
a <u>Me</u>thanol -reformer and a <u>100</u>% selective membrane. <br>
<br>
 Hydrogen from the Me100 was fed directly, dry, into a T/J Technology fuel cell with 5 cm<font size="1"><sup>2</sup></font> active area operated at 50&deg;C. The fuel cell membrane was Nafion 117 coated with TJ-PtRuMo/C catalyst, 0.53 mg/cm<font size="1"><sup>2</sup></font>, at the anode and a Pt/C catalyst, 0.48 mg/cm<font size="1"><sup>2</sup></font>,
at the cathode. Oxygen flow was maintained at 0 psig and 100 ml/min.
throughout. For comparison tests hydrogen flow from a hydrogen bottle
(Airgas) and from the Me100 reactor was maintained at 85 ml/min. by use
of a software controlled adjustable bleed, controlled by Alltech
Associates,Inc. Mass flow controllers. We used dry hydrogen throughout
and chose this low operating temperature to make the tests more
sensitive to CO poisoning and at the same time more typical of the
likely feed to current portable fuel cells. Humidification might also
have added to the variability to the experimental results as
humidification history affects nafion membrane aging. With the
controlled bleed, the hydrogen pressure was about 0 psig at the fuel
cell, both with the Me100 and the bottled hydrogen source.<br>
<br> A latter test was run in dead-end mode with the membrane reactor
hydrogen. In this mode of operation, the hydrogen flow rate is
controlled by hydrogen demand at the fuel cell, and the hydrogen
pressure is allowed to vary. No effort was made to adjust the
methanol-water feed to match the hydrogen demand, and as a result the
hydrogen pressure increased at low amperage, rising as high as 25 psig.
We measured the power curves, shown in Figure 3 as voltage vs current
density, using a PC controlled Scribner 890B Fuel Cell Test Station.
The power curve experiment sequences took approximately 20 minutes
each, and so provided a first demonstration of load following. <br>
<br>
<b>RESULTS:<br>
</b><br> We found a startup time on the order of 5 minutes. At
operating temperature, the temperature varied along the length of the
reactor by 50-60&deg;C with the maximum in the middle. This variation is
more than could be explained by the heat of reaction and the heat of
boiling given the high thermal conductivity of the copper boiler tube.
Further, if this variation were caused by endothermicity, the
temperature should have been a minimum in the center of the reactor if
the membrane reactor, as predicted by Amphlett et al. (6). We
tentatively attribute the temperature gradient to heat loss at the ends
of the reactor. At these operating conditions with the sudchemie
catalyst, the Me100 produced a maximum of 150 cc/min. of hydrogen, or
enough to generate 30 amps in a fuel cell. Depending on the pump rate,
the off gas could be made flammable or not, but no effort was made to
use heat from burning the waste gases to heat the reactor.<br>
The voltage versus current density observed with this reformer and fuel
cell is shown in Figure 3. The results with bottled hydrogen set to 0
psig using the bleed are shown in black, those with membrane reformer
hydrogen set to 0 psig using the bleed are shown in red, and those with
reformer hydrogen in dead-end mode (no bleed, varying pressure) are
shown in blue. We performed several runs with bottled hydrogen and
reformer hydrogen because there was considerable scatter in the
performance curves, especially at the start with the bottled hydrogen.
This scatter is typical of operation with dry hydrogen, and relates to
membrane conditioning / hydration - dehydration effects. The power
output is consistent with previous measurements on this fuel cell at
50&deg;C with dry hydrogen in constant bleed mode. <br>

<b>Figure 3. Performance curve</b> with non humidified bottled H<font size="1"><sub>2</sub></font> and non humidified REB Me100 membrane reactor H<font size="1"><sub>2</sub></font> in a T/J Technology PEMFC at 50&deg;C, iR corrected.<br>
<br> Figure 3 shows that the performance with bottled hydrogen (black
lines) is virtually identical to that with membrane reactor hydrogen
(red lines). Studies at the Royal Military College (7) using Ballard
fuel cells show a nearly 75% decrease in power density for even 10 ppm
CO and results with T/J fuel cells fed impure hydrogen (unpublished)
are similar. Figure 3 shows a slight fall off in voltage with the
membrane reactor hydrogen at high currents, but the dead-end
performance suggests this may be due to mass transportation differences
between the bottle and the reformer. That is the hydrogen bottle
maintains hydrogen pressures better at high fuel cell demands. The
Me100 hydrogen pressure in flow through mode is probably lower than
that delivered by the cylinder. <br>
<br> The fuel cell power curve with membrane reactor hydrogen in
dead-end mode is uniformly higher than with either reformer or bottled
hydrogen with a bleed. Dead end operation is generally not used since
it tends to concentrate any impurities in the hydrogen feed. The high
observed voltages, especially at middle and high current densities
suggests that our reformer hydrogen is essentially 100% pure. That the
voltage is higher with reformer gas in dead end mode that with cylinder
gas and reformer gas in flow through mode is pressure related, at least
partially. In dead -end mode, the Me100 hydrogen pressure varied with
the load and rose as high as 25 psig at zero flow. Generally, fuel cell
voltages increase with higher hydrogen pressures. Other possible
contributors to the increased power curve in Figure 3 include increased
hydrogen humidity as water is not swept from the system with the bleed.
Whatever the explanation, dead-end fuel cell operation seems preferable
with membrane reactor hydrogen, at least with this type of fuel cell.
Dead-end mode might have produced less power had significant amounts of
impurities transversed the fuel cell membrane either from the air side
or the hydrogen side. Low permeation appears to be typical of nafion
membranes like those used here (8), but is not with all the alternative
membranes currently under development.<br>

<b>Figure 4. Voltage response of T/J PEMFC powered by REB membrane H<font size="1"><sub>2</sub></font> generator at 50&deg;C.</b> The current pulsed from 0.1A to 1A with 100 Hz and 10% duty cycle, no iR correction.<br>
<br> The experiments in Figure 3 had a cycle time of about 15 minutes,
and did not show a clear loss of voltage versus steady state; that is
it showed load following at this time scale. To measure fuel cell
response at higher cycle times, an experiment was performed where a HP
load bank, HP 6060B, was changed between .1 amp and 1 amp over 1
millisecond (1000&micro;s) with a cycle that repeated over 10 ms. The voltage
with membrane reactor hydrogen in dead-end operation, is shown in
Figure 4 as observed through a Tektronix TDS 210 oscilloscope. The load
amperage changes from .1 Amp to 1 Amp at about 3000&micro;s, and changes back
to .1 Amp at 4000&micro;s. For the 5 cm<font size="1"><sup>2</sup></font> fuel cell, this is the equivalent of a change between .02 A/cm<font size="1"><sup>2</sup></font> and .2 A/cm<font size="1"><sup>2</sup></font>,
and based on Figure 3, we expected steady state voltages of .85 V and
.72 V respectively. The voltages observed in Figure 4 are somewhat
lower, .77V at &#8216;steady state&#8217; and .02 A/cm2 . At 3000&micro;s (.2 A/cm2) the,
voltage dropped to .65V and subsequently went as low as .575 V and
falling by 4000&micro;s. The steady voltage difference between Figures 3 and
4 seems mostly due to the lack of iR correction in the transient
experiments, but the capacitance effect of transient charging the
double layer in the fuel cell may have played a role too. Full voltage
recovery at .1 amp occurred at about 6000 &micro;s, 2000 &micro;s (2 ms) after the
initial change, suggests that the time scale for the voltage recovery
in the reformer - fuel cell system is 2000 &micro;s. This is good enough for
most applications, and is much faster than is likely for load following
with any non-membrane reformer considered to date (3). Fast response
minimizes the need for capacitors (9) and makes it easier to design
control systems to maintain high efficiency and purity. <br>
<br>
<b>Future Directions: </b><br>
<br>
The set-up used here is suited only for laboratory use and does not
take advantage of the complete power of the membrane reactor for mobile
and remote hydrogen generation. As shown in Figure 2, only manual
adjustment of the methanol/water flow rate was available. further, heat
to the reactor was provided electrically, instead of by combustion of
waste gas as in Buxbaum (4). The next step for REB Research will be to
heat the reactor by methanol water combustion, and after that, to heat
it mostly from waste gas combustion. At steady state, burning the waste
gas to heat the reactor should provide system efficiencies over 90% of
the lower heat value of the methanol-water. Future work will also
explore different temperature control schemes to see how combustion
heating affects the way a fuel cell fed with reformer hydrogen follows
a changing electrical load. These experiments suggest there will be no
problem controlling hydrogen output if reactor heating is provided by
methanol combustion, since this should be similar to electrical heating.<br>
<br> With an appropriate methanol burner, the time scale for reactor
heating can be on the order of minutes as seen here during start-up.
Even a simple controller should have no problem at this time scale.
Controllability may decrease when heat comes from waste gas combustion
since changes in the partial pressure of hydrogen in the reactor (as in
response to changing power demands) will result in simultaneous changes
in the heat value of the offgas and in the heat demand of the reactor.
We are optimistic that we can find a control scheme that gives stable
control and high efficiency over a broad range of turn down, but we
have yet to pick a control strategy or to determine the ideal ratio of
thermal inertia to heat rate for the reactor. One buffer to immediate
changes in the hydrogen partial pressure is hydrogen absorption in the
metal membrane and catalyst. This buffer should promote stable control,
insuring that the exhaust gas will not become suddenly non-flammable in
response to a spike in fuel cell power demand. <br>
<br> One control scheme we are considering is to use a pressure sensor
within the hydrogen output to control the methanol/water pump delivery
rate, adjusting the methanol feed to maintain a hydrogen output
pressure of say 10 psig. Our idea is to maintain the reactor
temperature at a constant pressure (about 260 psi seems appropriate) by
exhausting waste gas, as done here. Our thought is to send all the
waste gas to the burner as in Buxbaum (6), and to turning on raw
methanol-water combustion only when this does not suffice to maintain
the reactor temperature within a desired range, or perhaps when the
exhaust from combustion leaves at too low a temperature. Another
thought is generally controlling the reactor temperature by the
methanol-water pump rate. A third control scheme is to drive the
methanol water pump directly from the mechanical energy within the
waste gas, using a non-electrical steam-water pump of the sort that is
sometimes used to provide feed water to steam engines. This last method
removes an energy inefficiency inherent in using electricity to pump
the liquid feed when plenty of pressure volume energy is available for
free in the waste gas. This pump is likely to make the overall design
lighter as well, but it may make it less controllable.<br>
