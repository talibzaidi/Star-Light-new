            <p>Before using the suction cup mount on your windshield,
check the state and local laws and ordinances where you drive. Some
state laws prohibit drivers from using suction mounts on their
windshields while operating motor vehicles. Other state laws allow the
suction mount to be located only in specific locations on the
windshield. Many other states have enacted restrictions against placing
objects on the windshield in locations that obstruct the driver's
vision.<strong> It is the user's responsibility to mount the Garmin
device in compliance with all applicable laws and ordinances.</strong> </p>
            <p>Where required, other Garmin dashboard or friction mount
options should be used. Always mount your Garmin device in a location
that does not obstruct the driver's view of the road. Neither Garmin
nor Star Lite International, LLC assume any responsibility for any
fines, penalties, or damages that may be incurred as a result of any
state or local law or ordinance relating to the use of your Garmin
device.</p>
