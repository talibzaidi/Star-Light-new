          <p>Free lifetime traffic updates may not be transferred to another 
person or another Garmin product. Lifetime traffic extends for the 
useful life of your Garmin traffic receiver (as long as you own a 
compatible Garmin GPS) or as long as Garmin receives traffic data from 
its traffic supplier, whichever is shorter. A traffic receiver&#8217;s &#8220;useful
 life&#8221; means the period during which the receiver (a) has the required 
technical capabilities to utilize current traffic data service and (b) 
is capable of operating as intended without major repairs. Traffic 
content not available for all areas.</p>
