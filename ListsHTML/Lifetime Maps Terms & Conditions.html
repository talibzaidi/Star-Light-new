				<h1>Garmin Lifetime Maps Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
				
				
				<p>If you purchase a n&uuml;Maps Lifetime subscription (sold separately 
or bundled together with certain GPS models), you will receive map 
updates when and as such updates are made available on the Garmin 
website during the useful life of 1 compatible Garmin product or as long
 as Garmin receives map data from a third party supplier, whichever is 
shorter. A product&#8217;s &#8220;useful life&#8221; means the period during which the 
product (a) has sufficient memory capacity and other required technical 
capabilities to utilize current map data and (b) is capable of operating
 as intended without major repairs. A product will be deemed to be out 
of service and its useful life to be ended if no updates have been 
downloaded for such product for a period of 24 months or more. Unless 
otherwise stated, the updates you receive under the subscription will be
 updates to the same geographic area included with your Garmin product 
when originally purchased. Third party content providers may change. In 
some instances, your Garmin product might not have sufficient memory 
remaining for you to load an update to the map data, in which case you 
will need to either (a) select reduced map data coverage for your 
updates, or (b) purchase separately a microSD&#8482;/SD&#8482; card (if and as 
applicable to your Garmin product) and load all or a portion of the map 
data coverage for your updates to the card and insert the card into the 
microSD/SD card slot contained in your Garmin product. If neither of the
 measures in (a) or (b) can be used to address your product&#8217;s lack of 
sufficient remaining memory, then Garmin may conclude that the &#8220;useful 
life&#8221; of your product has expired. Garmin may terminate your n&uuml;Maps 
Lifetime subscription at any time if you violate any of the terms of 
this agreement or your subscription. Your n&uuml;Maps Lifetime subscription 
may not be transferred to another Garmin product.</p>
