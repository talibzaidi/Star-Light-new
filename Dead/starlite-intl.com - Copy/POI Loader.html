<p style="font-family: arial;">Import customized points of interest
with the help of Garmin's new
POI Loader software. In today's fast-paced world, points of interest
are ever-changing. With the help of POI Loader, you can now add your
favorite new restaurant, or that supermarket having the grand opening,
as points of interest (POIs) to your compatible Garmin GPS. The
possibilities are endless &#8212; upload safety cameras or school zones, and
you will receive a warning if you are traveling too fast. In addition,
an optional proximity-alert feature notifies you of upcoming custom
POIs. Our free, new POI Loader software lets you personalize your GPS,
giving you the freedom and flexibility to literally go anywhere. </p>
<p style="font-family: arial;">As an added benefit to our customers,
you can download the latest version of POI Loader software for free
from the Garmin website.<br>

<p style="font-family: arial;" class="title">What are Points of
Interest?</p>
<p style="font-family: arial;">POIs include restaurants, hotels, post
offices, emergency services,
entertainment, plus much more, and are represented by small icons on
the maps displayed on your unit. Many of our mapping products, such as
MapSource <a href="http://www.garmin.com/cartography/ontheRoad/">City
Select</a> or <a href="http://www.garmin.com/cartography/ontheRoad/">City
Navigator</a>,
include a database of nearly 6 million points of interest. With POI
Loader, you can now add additional points of interest to your
compatible Garmin. This means you can upload custom POIs to supplement
the nearly 6 million points of interest that are already in your unit.
Traveling on holiday? Upload the POI for that bed &amp; breakfast that
just opened or the new restaurant that your guide book recommends.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial;">Custom
POIs can also include .bmp images, as well as speed and proximity alert
information. These POIs can be created by you, your friends, or third
parties. There are several free and subscription services on the
Internet that also provide POIs. </p>
<p style="font-family: arial;"><a name="loader"></a> </p>
<p style="font-family: arial;" class="title">How Does POI Loader Work?</p>
<p style="font-family: arial;">To
search and navigate to personalized POIs, you must first upload points
of interest from comma-separated text files (.csv) to your compatible
Garmin GPS or onto an SD card. </p>
<p style="font-family: arial;">With POI Loader, you
can configure your unit to alert you when you are within a certain
distance of a point or if you are driving over a certain speed near a
point &#8212; perfect to warn you about upcoming school zones, red lights,
and speed cameras. For more information on POI Loader, see the help
file that is included with the free software download. </p>
