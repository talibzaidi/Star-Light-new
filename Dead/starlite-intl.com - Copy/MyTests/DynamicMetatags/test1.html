    This file is the first test in a series [others were not necessary; just needed to extend file Details.asp] 
    that try to generate html pages using the Details.asp file
    so that not only the <body>...</body> part is dynamic but so also is the <head>..</head> part, e.g the
    <title>...</title> and other meta tags.

    The goal is to generate product Details pages where the <title>, <keywords>, and other meta tags can be specialized,
    using metatag values stored in the database, to match the actual dynamic product, so that resulting html page is 
    more like a normal static page.
    This will hopefully cause Google to give such generated pages a higher ranking in organic search results.
